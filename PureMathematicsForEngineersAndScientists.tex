\chapter*{Preface}


The basic aim is to provide exposure to a solid foundation of mathematics based on proofs.  The exit goals would be:

-Readers will be able to write valid proofs using the standard techniques of modern mathematics.

-Readers will be able to read and understand proofs at some reasonable level.

-Readers will have working knowledge of broad foundations of mathematics, and be able to confidently take dedicated courses in each area, or pursue independent studies.
    
    
From my experience, I certainly never got this stuff explicitly, but on retrospect, it certainly seems like it would help.     


Topics to be covered:

    Mathematical Foundations - Mathematical logic, basic notation, axiomatic set theory (Zermelo Frankel), Peano Axioms of Arithmetic, Godel theorems.


    Methods of Proof:  Induction, Contradiction, Direct Proofs.  Examples of classic proofs - infinite primes, irrationality of square root of two, etc.  Plenty of practice examples.


    Real Analysis - Study of real numbers, including construction by Dedekind Cuts etc, point set topology, continuity, metric spaces (Basically a compressed version of Rudin or equivalent).


    Modern Algebra:  Groups, Rings, Fields, Transformations, Representation Theory, Modules, Galois Theory


    Non-euclidean geometry and topology:  Various spaces and properties.  Invariants, knot theory, homotopy, homology.


    Number theory:


    Category theory:


    Computational complexity theory:  Finite Automata, lambda calculus, NP and other spaces.
